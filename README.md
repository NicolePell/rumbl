# Rumbl

Application that takes videos hosted elsewhere, and allows users to attach comments to them in real time and play them back alongside the comments of other users. 

Built following the book [Programming Phoenix](https://pragprog.com/book/phoenix/programming-phoenix) by Chris McCord, Bruce Tate, and Jos√© Valim.
